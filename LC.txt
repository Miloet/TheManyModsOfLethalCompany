LC mods ideas:

Buyable Lightning rod upgrade for the ship
	Removes / diverts random lightning
	Adds a chance the targeted lightning will strike the ship instead.

Monster energy case (scrap)
	if picked up by a hoarding bug it will  become very fast
	download the model of the bottles case and use that as the base

Hoarding bug plushie (high value scrap)

Comically large E-Pill bottle (high value scrap)
