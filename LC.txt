LC mods ideas:

Monster energy case (scrap)
	if picked up by a hoarding bug it will  become very fast
	download the model of the bottles case and use that as the base

Hoarding bug plushie (high value scrap)

(Hoarding) Bug snacks (equipment)
	makes the hoarding bugs very friendly to the player
	the bugs dance when given food (using hoarderbud)
		(in lateupdate if the bug is carrying food it will have its canhearmusic bool set to true in its hoarderMusicFlag componant)
public override void GrabItemFromEnemy(EnemyAI enemy)
{
	if(enemy is HoardingBugAI)
	{
		var bug = (HoardingBugAI)enemy;
		bug.BecomeFriends(15f);
	}
}

in a hoardingbug patch 
	public void BecomeFriends(float friendAmount)
	{
		angryTimer -= friendAmount;
		annoyanceMeter -= friendAmount;
	}
	public void BecomeFriendsWithAll(float friendAmount)
	{	
		foreach(HoardingBugAI bug in GetAllObjectOfType<HoardingBugAI>())
			bug.BecomeFriends(friendAmount);
	}

Electric Emergency stim shot (EESS) (equipment)
	heal a set amount of hp and has one use but can be recharged
