# Lethal Energy

Adds a crate of fizzy drinkable energy liquid as scrap to your local drink producing moons! Comes in packs of 2 to 12 but usually 7 for some reason. Drinking this liquid has been proved to enhance speed by as much as 50% per liter drunk! However any dose above 2 liters have proved fatal in most cases unless drank over a long period.

You are able to change the spawn rates of the crate for different moons in the config settings!
The cans are also purchasable at your local 1970s computer terminal for the low low price of 10$ a pop! (subject to change)

## Future Development
If this mod picks up a decent following I am inclined to add more features like expanded config options for adjustable:
- **Duration** 
- **Speed Boost**
- **Death threshold**
- **Etc...**
