# CruiserTunes
This mod allows you to add custom songs to the cruiser radio. It also has some optional quality of life features such as removing looping and random* playback times, notifications for nearby player when a new song starts playing and the option to remove the original songs. 


## Installation
Custom songs are to be placed in a folder called 'CustomSongs'. This can be located in any of three places.
Using your mod manager of choice go to Settings...

From here you can create or put your .mp3's into one of three 'CustomSongs' folders. 
1. CustomSongs in **plugins**

Here is an example of how these addons are to be structured: [CruiserTunesExampleAddon](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Mellowdy/CruiserTunesExampleAddon/)

***(NOTE: all song files must be .mp3 files, I recomend that you compress the sound files to reduce memory usage and load times. Additonal note: if the 'CustomSongs' folder does not exist in any of these places you can create one. Make sure it's name is spellt correctly. )***
